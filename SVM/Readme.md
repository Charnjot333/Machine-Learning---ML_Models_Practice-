# SVM(SVR) - Project 
# üß† SVM (SVR) Project ‚Äì Predicting the Baltimore Salary

This project demonstrates how to predict employee salaries in Baltimore using the Support Vector Regression (SVR) algorithm.
The notebook walks through data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation to understand how regression-based Support Vector Machines can capture salary patterns.

---

## üöÄ Objectives

- Analyze the Baltimore salary dataset

- Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)

- Train and test Support Vector Regression (SVR) models

- Evaluate model performance using appropriate regression metrics

- Visualize the relationship between predicted and actual salaries

## üß© Technologies Used
- Python

- Pandas, NumPy ‚Äì for data handling

- Matplotlib, Seaborn ‚Äì for data visualization

- scikit-learn ‚Äì for machine learning (SVR model and preprocessing)

---
## üìä Results

- SVR successfully predicted salaries with reasonable accuracy.

- The RBF kernel gave the most balanced performance among tested kernels.

- The model can be further improved using feature scaling, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation.
